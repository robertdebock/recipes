## Ingredients

- 380 grams of flower.
- 120 grams of whole flower.
- 325 grams of water at 37 degrees Celcius.
- 12 grams of salt.
- 2 grams of yeast.

## Requirements

- Scale in grams.

- Bowl for rising.
- Banneton for proving.
- Cloth or pan lid to cover the dough.
- Oven for baking.

## Recipe

It takes quite some time to make this bread, so please understand all steps and adjust your timings in order to have bread on time. I use these timings.

- Start in the morning to have bread ready by dinner.
- Start in the evening to have bread ready by lunch.
- Having bread ready by breakfast is difficult, because you need a 1 hour rise, 30 minutes bake and 30 minutes rest. Next best thing is to have a bread ready in the evening, store it under a cloth and eat it in the morning.

### Prepare (3 hours)

Resting, rising and proving should be done with a cover over the dough.
